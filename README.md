Hello, here's my new Icon Theme isn't finish, I have to do a lot of work but I want to share with you a beta version. This theme fits very well with [Faba Of Sam Hewitt](https://github.com/snwh/faba-icon-theme). I recommend you to download this theme too.

I enjoy this theme so much and hope it will be the case for you too. Bugs please repport it.
